# erf

*embarrasing relative finder*

The embarrasing relatives are broken or dead files, modules, classes, methods in a codebase. erf helps locate them ready for removal or refactoring.

Reads files in a codebase (following .gitignore) and determines dependency graph. Identifies isolated or near-isolated subgraphs, dead code. Subsequent ranking is done by lines of code - excessively long files, modules, classes, methods are embarassing.

Two interfaces : MCP stdio and browser-based GUI.

The MCP should provide simple tools that a coding assistant like Claude can use to help refactor, clean codebases. The GUI will feature a force-directed spring layout graph of the nodes in dependency tree, with filters for eg. just files etc. Lines of code count will be reflected in the size of the nodes in the visual graph.

* Node.js project using ES modules
* RDF-Ext RDF model for graph data
* UI packaged with Vite
* Tested with Vite & Playwright
* loglevel for logging

It should be as lightweight as possible, easy to deploy as an npm dev package in an existing codebase or via MCP, e.g. Claude in VS Code.
